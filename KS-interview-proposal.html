"2. Commit to writing in a text editor with good syntax highlighting, and start writing HTML and CSS. For everything. Old habits hold people back more than the challenges of learning something new. Even if ultimately you have to submit something, like a journal article, in Microsoft Word, do your composing in HTML." -Karl Stolley, "Source Literacy: A Vision of Craft."

Okay. So I am taking Karl's advice, and am composing this proposal for an extended interview with him for Kairos in Notepad ++. There - file just saved as HTML. So far, so good, though I'm a little concerned that my first line of text seems to stretch toward infinity. Notepad ++ has a word wrap option; ah, much better.

I have to admit, I thought of myself as tech-savvy. I am staunchly pro open-source. I design multimedia assignments,  I know a little bit of HTML. <!--Stuck a bit in my writing; if I were in Libre Office right now, I'd start formatting the text, put the book title in italics. I will resist the temptation to start tinkering with that here, for now.--> I even installed a wireless router for my mom on my own. [gah, more obvs, transition to KS work vs. my practice] Though actually, now that I think about it, I "comment on my source" when I write. I leave myself note in brackets all the time; like I'm talking to myself. So that's something. I guess I should move my bracketed notes here into syntax. (oh hey, it's on page 143.)

"3. Learn the distributed version control system Git, and establish a GitHub account." - Karl Stolley, "Source Literacy: A Vision of Craft."

Done. Margaret M. Strain and D. Alexis Hart, interview section editors of Kairos, I hope you will indulge me this experiment written in a stream of consciousness fashion: I'm going to write this whole proposal in HTML and upload my work every night to GitHub on my newly-created GitHub account. 
<--shoot, was I supposed to be doing this in GitHub the whole time? OK, no, thanks Google-->
